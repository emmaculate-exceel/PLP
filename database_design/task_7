# Data visualization with spreadsheets
This week the aim is to learn how we can use tools like Microsoft Excel and Google Sheets to make a dashboard for the data that we already have

## What you'll need:
- Access to a computer with internet access
- Access to google sheets or Microsoft excel (e.g., Visual Studio Code)
- Access to a dataset. <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17LvSL5-ZS7KNNpByRdbcx0YEEi13N8UDn3QRtkHdOY4/edit?usp=sharing">Click Here</a> to get the data set

## Submission
- Once you open the dataset, Click on where it is written ```File``` and ```Make a copy```
