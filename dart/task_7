Part 1: Interactive Widgets Enhance Send Money Page:

UI Elements: Add a TextField for the recipient's name and amount, a DropdownButton for selecting the payment method, and a Switch for marking the transaction as a favorite. Styling: Ensure all elements are visually appealing and aligned properly within the layout.

Form Validation:

Implement validation rules for the TextFields: Recipient name must not be empty. Amount must be a positive number. Provide visual feedback (e.g., error messages) when validation fails.

Part 2: Custom Widgets

Create Reusable Button:

Design a custom button widget specifically for sending money, ensuring itâ€™s reusable across different screens. UI Consistency:

Apply consistent styles to all custom widgets, including colors, fonts, and spacing to maintain a cohesive look throughout the app.

Part 3: Animations Implement UI Animations:

Use AnimatedContainer or AnimatedOpacity to create a smooth transition for important UI elements, like the success message after a transaction. Page Transitions:

Add custom transitions between the login page and the dashboard to improve the visual flow of the app.
